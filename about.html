      Her name is Nadia, she was born on June 1, 2006, I am very impressed with Nadia, she is very beautiful, smart and religious, even when I see her or am by her side I feel very nervous.
         Apart from having a beautiful face, Nadia has very beautiful eyes like the moon that lights up the dark night.
         What I like most about Nadia is her gentle attitude, easy smile, and often advises me when I'm doing something wrong, I hope, I want to always be by her side, because with Nadia beside me, I feel comfortable, I'm very confident in myself. I myself think that no one is the same as Nadia and no one is even better than Nadia
         in any case, because in my personal opinion Nadia is a figure of perfection, and perfection is Nadia's figure.
         I always pray to God that Nadia and I will always be together, until our hair turns white.

     <p> i remember the first time I met Nadia, I was so nervous that I couldn’t say a single word when I saw her. But she was so cheerful that I slowly started talking to her. Honestly, I never expected her to change me so quickly, from being shy to becoming someone very confident when she’s by my side. I think with Nadia next to me, I could conquer the world, hahaha.
      babe, i just wanna tell you something,you are best gf in the world,you are my partner,you are my everything, i lovee you babe,i dont wanna lose you,plss stay with me.

      "I think Nadia is a very rare person to find. Nadia knows so much about me; she is the perfect partner for me. I don't want to lose her, and I also want to protect her so that no one else can take her. She is also someone I respect. I am sure there is no one else in this world who is like her or better than her. She is like a gem to me. I always pray to God that we are always brought together. LOVE YOU MY DEAR."
